# **Trie**
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. 
There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.
-> It is a DS that stores data from top to bottom.
-> Two types  a> Tries on Characters 
              b> Tries on Bits (0,1)

Some Important Link -> https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/Using%20Tries
I have note it down few important points from this website.
Why use Trie if the same thing we can do with the help of Set and Map. Two main reason
    #1.The tries can insert and find strings in O(L) time (where L represent the length of a single word). This is much faster than set , 
       but is it a bit faster than a hash table. 
    #2.The set <string> and the hash tables can only find in a dictionary words that match exactly 
       with the single word that we are finding; the trie allow us to find words that have a single character different, 
       a prefix in common, a character missing, etc.
